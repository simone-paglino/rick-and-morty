<h1 align="center">:sparkles: rick-and-morty exercise :sparkles:</h1>

#### Some notes to read before viewing the exercise:
- Usually the standards I work with have a goal of 100% coverage with testing, but this time, due to some lack of time, only the 80% was met.
- Redux hasn't been used because usually big apps with a complex structure and operational flows require it.<br />
For similar reasons, other libraries for styling haven't been used (Tailwind, MUI, Bootstrap ecc.)
- The project structure was based following the principles of Atomic Design (elements, organisms, templates, layouts, pages).<br /> 
If you want to talk more about this, feel free to contact me on LinkedIn üòÅ.
